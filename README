# About Drive Proxy

Drive Proxy is a Windows Service that streamlines communication with Google
Drive. It is meant to facilitate the construction of tools that leverage Google
Drive's cloud storage capacity without burdening the hard drive and network with
unnecesary local copies. Drive Proxy handles authentication with Google Drive
and manages the cache where the needed files reside.

It uses a simple protocol to communicate with client applications over a pipe.
It is currently used by the DriveFusion project to provide a transparent
interface between Windows Explorer and Google Drive.

# Build instructions

In the ProjectConfig.txt file, replace the placeholders for your client ID,
client secret and installer upgrade code with your own. Then open the solution
and rebuild all.

# Installation instructions

This project should not be installed on its own. The client application should
install it as part of its installation.

# Usage

The service can not be used by itself, instead an application would use it to
communicate with Google Drive. The Drive Fusion project is an example of such an
application.
